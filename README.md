# Clustering and pca
 Categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.

## Overview:
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes.

After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid. 

And this is where we come in as a data analyst. Our job is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then we need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.  The datasets containing those socio-economic factors and the corresponding data dictionary are provided below.

## Objectives:
Our main task is to cluster the countries by the factors mentioned above and then present our solution and recommendations to the CEO using a PPT.

We will perform PCA on the dataset and obtain the new dataset with the Principal Components. Then we need to perform your clustering activity on this new dataset, i.e. the PCA modified dataset with the k components.
Analyse the clusters and identify the ones which are in dire need of aid by comparing how these three variables - [gdpp, child_mort and income] vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.
